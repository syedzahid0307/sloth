/**
 * Bridges the SDK's [SessionStore] to whatever refresh-token persistence the
 * app already has (typically [PikPakConfig] via DataStore). Only the refresh
 * token is persisted; the short-lived access token is recomputed on each app
 * start via a single refresh round-trip, which is cheaper than the schema
 * migration needed to widen [PikPakConfig] with accessToken/expiresAt/sub.
 *
 * [load] synthesises a [Session] with `expiresAt = 0` so the SDK treats the
 * cached access token as already stale and goes straight into refresh. If
 * [readRefreshToken] yields an empty string, we return `null` and the SDK
 * falls through to full credentials sign-in.
 *
 * [onSessionSaved] is invoked after a successful [save]. It is meant as a
 * hook for platform modules to do post-signin hygiene on the credentials —
 * historically wiping the plaintext password from DataStore. That wipe is
 * currently a no-op (see the `TODO(pikpak-credential-keystore)` comments in
 * the platform Koin modules) because the engine has no OS-keystore fallback
 * yet, so we keep the password on disk to recover when the refresh token
 * gets revoked. The callback contract stays in place so a future keystore
 * migration can restore the wipe without touching this adapter.
